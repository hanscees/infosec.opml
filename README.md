freshrss file for infosec resources

Hi, I have an freshrss instance in my homelab. I want to follow infosec resources. 

Looking for an opml file to load multiple rss feeds I found an md file. Converted it and share it with the internet, cause why not.

So no need for a commercial rss agregator. Enjoy and please do tell me where to find a better one.
